# Stopwatch (JavaScript)

A simple stopwatch built as part of my JavaScript studies at Get Academy.
The project is implemented using **vanilla JavaScript** with a lightweight MVC-inspired structure.

---

## Features

- **Start** – starts the stopwatch
- **Pause** – pauses the timer, stores a lap time, and resets the counter
- **Stop & Reset** – stops the timer and clears all lap times
